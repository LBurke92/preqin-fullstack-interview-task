# Preqin API

This contains the API source code for the preqin fullstack interview task.
This is built using a Python/FastAPI Framework with peewee as an ORM. (Or that is at least what will be attempted)

# Getting Started

You will need to install `fastapi` and `peewee` using pip.

To run the server you can simply run `fastapi dev`.
