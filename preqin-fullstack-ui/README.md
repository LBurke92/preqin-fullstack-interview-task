# Preqin UI

This contains the UI source code for the preqin fullstack interview task.
This is built using React + Typescript + Vite using `npm create vite@latest`

# Getting Started

You will need to install `Node.js` before anything, instructions for which can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

At the time of building this I used `Node v20.12.1` so I would reccomend at least this version. Using `nvm` is a great tool to manage multiple version of Node.js on your machine and is highly reccomended as well.

You will then need to install all dependencies in your preferred manner using `yarn` or `npm`

e.g `npm install`

Create an appropriate .env file which can be copied from .env.example for local testing.

# Starting the application

You should be able to run the application using

`npm run dev`

And then be able to open it at http://localhost:5173/
